<!--"A technical post aimed at DSs/statisticians. I do not cover what bayesian statistics is, its distinction from frequentist statistics or machine learning nor why it's useful and why fitting bayesian models are useful. There are numerous other posts on that matter. Although the various types of output and model inferences that can be made will be talked about in another post"

I've chosen to use [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) to do my modelling. Stan is a probabilistic programming language that can fleixbly estimate a wide range of probabilistic and bayesian models. It uses state of the art samplers such as hamiltonian monte carlo (HMC) which allows efficient estimation of models with high dimensions without the need for conjugate priors. It is used across academia and industry and noteably in facebook's open source forecasting tool, [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)

-->

I spent the last few years studying Bayesian statistics in my spare time. Most recently I completed the first edition of Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking - including his 2017 lecture series and problem sets. This on going learning is complemented by reading numerous tutorials and case studies from the statistics community plus documentation for probabilistic programming languages (Stan and PyMC3).

So I decided to write up an application of what I've learned so far using the Ames Housing Dataset from the kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). The goal is to practise what I've learned in my self study journey and hopefully demonstrate some of the best practices advocated by those in the applied statistics community.


<!--

So I decided to write up an example of applying a bayesian statistics workflow
I decided to writeup an example of using a bayesian workflow using a dataset from kaggle. The proposed workflow I adoped was a mix of blogs and papers from prominent statisticians in the field. 

A recurring theme from members of the bayesian community is the importance of workflow. My formal education in econometrics placed more emphasis on tools and derivations for applied predictive or causal inference. "Workflow" or the _structure_ of data analysis and model building was not explicitly covered. At best, components of workflow were explored in some applied research seminars.

## Thinking about workflow
A recurring theme in applied statistics is the importance of workflow. My formal education in econometrics placed more emphasis on tools and derivations for applied predictive or causal inference. "Workflow" or the _structure_ of data analysis and model building was not explicitly covered. At best, components of workflow were explored in some applied research seminars.

Developments around workflow are a current topic of research. The most recent paper came out on November 2nd titled [Bayesian Workflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf) which has many contributions from prominent members in the statistics community. This writeup was prepared before I had a chance to read the paper, but I hope it covers some of the principles and recommendations. And if not, like statistical models, the way I do data analysis will iterate and improve. 

A good workflow supports quality model building. It forces us to think critically about decision making in data analysis which helps us evaluate our assumptions and identify errors or limitations. That isn't to say there is a gold standard of how all data analysis should be conducted. Rather, following a robust workflow guides modelling decisions and helps diagnose problems when iterating on model complexity.


<!--Rather, it is a set of guidelines on how to approach modelling so that it is best placed to help answer domain specific questions. It is also a good way of iterating on model complexity. It provides a set of sensible defaults which help evaluate the assumptions of model design and identify errors.

The proposed workflow I adopted was inspired from [blog posts](https://khakieconomics.github.io/2016/08/29/What-is-a-modern-statistical-workflow.html) by Jim Savage a few years ago and more recently, Monica Alexander's [example](https://www.monicaalexander.com/posts/2020-28-02-bayes_viz/) of visualiastion in an end to end bayesian analysis. This was reinforced by the visualisation in bayesian workflow paper quoted above.

The bolded steps below will be discussed in this post. I have reserved the other steps for a separate blog post using more complicated models. For the curious, more detailed examples on various bayesian models can be found in the [Stan case studies](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies), [PyMC3 docs](https://docs.pymc.io/nb_examples/index.html) and in particular, Michael Betancourt's case study on a [Principled Bayesian Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html#1_questioning_authority).

### **Steps in proposed workflow**

1)  **Exploratory data analysis and data transformation**

<!-- Step 1.5? Do you need a model? Most of my time is spent in 1 and 1.5-->

2)  **Write out full probability model**

3)  **Prior predictive checks - simulate data from the implied generative model**

4)  **Fit model on fake data - can we recover the known parameters?**

5)  **Estimate model on real data**

6) Check whether MCMC sampler ran efficiently and model convergence

7) **Posterior predictive check to evaluate model fit**

8) Model selection using cross validation and information criteria

9) _Optional:_ Evaluate model performance on test or out of sample dataset (not strictly necessary if the modelling task is not a predictive problem)

<!--Note, this a minimal working example of a bayesian workflow and the rationale for its steps. Much more robust and detailed methods can be found in the [Stan case studies](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies), in particular Michael Betancourt's case study on a [Principled Bayesian Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html#1_questioning_authority).-->

# Predicting housing prices{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The models I propose in this example are deliberately simple. I want to emphasise workflow, diagnostics and to clearly layout my decision making and assumptions for criticism. It is by no means a full analysis which intends to optimise predictive performance out of sample. 

<!--
"Not a full data analysis"

The target variable in this dataset is `SalePrice`. I focus on variables which describe any _structure_ (nested levels or clusters) in the dataset in relation to the `SalePrice` and are consistent with my understanding of how housing prices change in response to different characteristics. This is opposed to doing full variable selection on the 79 available features using algorithmic tools like PCA.

The models I propose here are deliberately simple. I want to emphasise workflow, diagnostics and to interrogate my assumptions in model building. It is by no means a full analysis which intends to optimise predictive performance out of sample.

The target variable in this dataset is `SalePrice`. To keep things simple, I focused on variables which describe any _structure_ in the dataset in relation to the `SalePrice`. That is,  whether or not there are nested levels or clusters within the data in relation to the dependent variable as opposed to running full feature selection or dimensionality reduction (there are 79 features in the raw data). 

The objective of this post is to start with a simple set of models to motivate the intuition of the workflow. This is opposed to building something extremely complicated from the get go to optimise out of sample predictive performance.

he objective of this competition was to predict the `SalePrice` and minimise RMSE in the test dataset. The objective of this post however, is to start with a set of simple models to motivate the intuition of the workflow, as opposed to building something which optimises out of sample predictive performance. -->

## Python

### 1) Exploratory data analysis and data transformation

The full dataset for this competition contains 79 features to predict the target variable `SalesPrice`. For this exercise I will focus on two variables: `Neighbourhood` (categorical: physical locations within Ames city limits) and `LotArea` (positive real: lot size in square feet). I chose these variables as they are consistent with my understanding of how housing prices vary in relation to their location and the size of the land/lot. 

```{python eval=FALSE}
import pystan
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import arviz as az

%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

az.style.use('arviz-darkgrid')

df = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/train.csv').loc[['SalePrice', 'LotArea', 'Neighborhood']]

df.head()
```

```{python include=FALSE}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/train.csv')[['SalePrice', 'LotArea', 'Neighborhood']]

# Standardise predictors
def z_std(x):
    """
    Centres at mean 0 and standard deviation 1
    """
    z_score = (x - x.mean()) / x.std()
    return(z_score)

df['log_sales_price'] = np.log(df['SalePrice'])
df['log_lot_area'] = np.log(df['LotArea'])

df['log_sales_price_z'] = z_std(df[['log_sales_price']])
df['log_lot_area_z'] = z_std(df[['log_lot_area']])

#df['log_sales_price_std'] = df['log_sales_price']/df['log_sales_price'].mean()

df['neighbourhood'] = df['Neighborhood'].astype('category').cat.codes+1
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(kableExtra)
head(py$df)
```

<!--First we visualise the distribution of the target variable. We immediately see there is a positive skew in the distribution. Taking the natural log of this gives an approximately normal distribution.

```{python eval=FALSE}
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (13, 5))
df['SalePrice'].plot.hist(title = 'Sales Price', ax = axes[0])
np.log(df['SalePrice']).plot.hist(title = 'log(Sales Price)', ax = axes[1])

# Adjust x axis on both plots
axes[0].set_xlim(1000, 800000)
axes[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: str(int(x/1000))))
axes[0].set_xlabel("$('000)")

axes[1].set_xlabel("Log prices")
```

<center>
![](figures/1_histograms.svg)
</center>
-->

A scatter plot shows a positive correlation between `log(SalePrice)` and `log(LotArea)` as expected. Fitting OLS on the logorithms of both variables assumes a linear relationship on the multiplicative scale. All else equal, property prices tend to be higher with larger land sizes. However, this univariate linear model clearly underfits the data and there is almost surely some unobserved confounder variable(s).

```{python eval=FALSE}
sns.lmplot(x='log_lot_area',y='log_sales_price',data=df,fit_reg=True, ci = False)
plt.tight_layout()
```

<center>
![](figures/2_pooling_scatter.svg)
</center>

A potential reason for underfitting may be some neighbourhoods have higher average prices than other neighbourhoods (which would result in different intercepts). Furthermore, the _association_ between housing prices and lot size may depend on different neighbourhood effects (varying slopes). For example, inner city neighbourhoods which have higher density housing or apartments may be relatively more expensive per square foot than outer suburban sprawls. We can visualise this in the small multiple plots below, observing the variation of linear trends between neighbourhoods.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
facet_scatter = sns.lmplot(x="log_lot_area", 
                           y="log_sales_price", 
                           col="Neighborhood",
                           col_wrap = 5,
                           data=df,
                           ci = None, 
                           truncate=False,
                           col_order = sorted(df['Neighborhood'].drop_duplicates()))

facet_scatter.set(xlim=(5, 15))
facet_scatter.set(ylim=(5, 15))
```

<center>
![](figures/3_facet_scatter.svg)
</center>

We can see some variation in the slopes and intercepts as expected. Some suburbs have more observations than others. This and other unobserved confounders probably contributed to the negative slope in one of the neighbourhoods. The small sample size of some neighbourhoods will be prone to overfitting and noisy estimates which will require some regularisation.  

### 2) Write out full probability model

There are 3 basic models we can use to approach this problem:

1) Pooled OLS (ignores the structure given my `neighbourhood`, assumes all observations come from "one neighbourhood")
2) No pooling OLS (conceptually the same as a dummy variable regression - assumes independence between all neighbourhoods)
3) Saturated regression (adds interactive effects between `log(LotArea)_i` and `neighbourhood` to no pooling OLS)

I will use the no pooling OLS model to demonstrate rest of the workflow. These models can certainly be improved on. In fact, this problem is a good candidate for _hierarchical_ or _multilevel_ models. This allows information to be borrowed between neighbourhood through partial pooling and removes the assumption of independence between clusters. This will be extremely useful given that the sample is imbalanced across `neighbourhood` and will help regularise the effects of small sample sizes. I will introduce these models in another post. 

#### Model specification

The no pooling regression is written out below, where $i$ indexes the property and $j$ indexes each neighbourhood. I've assigned a gaussian likelihood which assumes that the residuals are normally distributed. 

$$
y_i \sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
 \\
\mu_i = \alpha_{j} + \beta * x_i \\
$$
Where $y_i$ is `log(SalesPrice)` and $x_i$ is `log(LotArea)` scaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. $\alpha_j$ is an intercept parameter for the jth neighbourhood in the sample. The slope coefficient can be interpreted as: a one standard deviation increase in `log(LotArea)` is a $\beta$ standard deviation change in `log(SalesPrice)`. 

<!--Where $y_i$ is `log(SalesPrice)` scaled by it's mean value and $x_i$ is `log(LotArea)` scaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Scaling $y_i$ like this makes the average value of the outcome variable to be mean 1. Since SalePrice is on the log scale, a value of 1.1 for  $y_i$ can be interpreted as 10\% higher relative to the average value. Similarly, 0.7 can be interpreted as 70\% of the average value.-->

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Center and scale predictor
df['log_lot_area_z'] = (df['log_lot_area'] - df['log_lot_area'].mean()) / df['log_lot_area'].std()

# Scale target
df['log_sales_price_z'] = (df['log_sales_price'] - df['log_sales_price'].mean()) /df['log_sales_price']std()

```

$$
y_i = \frac{log(SalesPrice)_i - \overline{log(SalesPrice)}}{\sigma_{log(SalesPrice)}} \\
x_i = \frac{log(LotArea)_i - \overline{log(LotArea)}}{\sigma_{log(LotArea)}}
$$

Standardising both outcome and predictor variables makes sampling from the posterior distribuion easier when we fit the model. If we had more continuous regressors, we could also compare the parameteres on the same scale. Standardising also plays an important role in setting priors as we'll see below.


<!-- Potential question: Why different scaling? For y, using mean 0 and std 1. Index variable allows us to assign the same prior to all categories. I thought it would be easier to articulate prior choices of the $\alpha$ coefficients if they were in percentages of the overall mean when I first attempted this. I had already stuck with this scaling for all my other models by the time I got to the writeup. In hindsight, it may have been easier to express the priors if I had centered and scaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. I'll be curious to hear people's thoughts on whether this scaling would be more intuitive, or perhaps easier to express priors.-->

### Selecting priors

We need to assign distributions to the parameters for this to be a probability or bayesian model. I have chosen weakly informative priors following the advice of the [stan developers](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations). I do not have domain expertise in this specific dataset to give more informative priors. I do have some understanding of how property prices worked which guided my intital EDA. However, I can still choose sensible priors that at least regularlise model results and are within the plausible outcome space.

For $\beta$ we want to assign priors to hedge against overfitting. $\beta=0$ implies that on average, there is no association between sales price and lot area. Without much prior information I want to shrink $\beta$ closer towards zero. So all we really want to do is to assign probability to all plausible values of $\beta$ in this particular model, with less weight on extreme relationships. I'll assign $\beta$ a $Normal(0, 1)$ distribution. This assumes that roughly 95\% of the probability is within 2 standard deviations of the mean for a unit incrase in $x_i$.

$\alpha_j$ is the intercept for the $j^{th}$ neighbourhood. In a simple linear (pooled) regression between price and lot area, the intercept $\alpha$ (ignoring the neighbourhood means ignoring the j subscript) would be interpreted as the value of of $y$ when $x$ is 0. Since $x$ has a mean of zero, $\alpha$ has the additional interpretation as the value of $y$ when $x$ is equal to its sample mean. By construction, $\alpha$ must be 0, the sample mean of $y$.

So in the case of $\alpha_j$ I set a normal prior with a mean of 0 and a standard deviaion of 1 for all neighbourhoods, regularising neighbourhood effects within two standard deviations of the mean of $y$. 

The variance parameter $\sigma$ is defined over positive real numbers. So our prior should only put probabilistic weight on positive values. In this case I've chosen an exponential(1) prior. Other candidate priors are the half-cauchy distribution or the half-normal which has thinner tails.

<!--Maybe a footnote: I was playing around the idea with putting a strictly positive prior on beta, i.e only a strict positive relationship between lot area and price. But in this case I really only wanted the priors to be regularising without any other information. Also, I feel less inclined to put more informative priors given that I really don't have much other domain understanding of how housing prices work in this side of the world. There is also a lot of confounding in this simple model so a range of possible positive or negative values are likely. -->

These weakly regulating priors express my belief that the parameters of this model would overfit the sample and that we need to regularise their effects. Standardising the variables made this job much easier and intuitive. All together the full model looks like:

$$
y_i \sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha_{j} + \beta * x_i \\
\alpha_j\sim Normal(0, 1)\\
\beta\sim Normal(0, 1) \\
\sigma\sim exp(1)
$$


<!--Using unscaled predictors often results in the intercept being uninterpretable without the context of other model parameters. As a result, it is often highly correlated with the predictor coefficients and requires weak priors. -->

<!--
#### Scaled variables

First, we want to standardise our outcome and predictor variables.  This will make it easier to assign priors for parameters and sample from the posterior for model estimation.  It will also help produce model outputs that are more interpretable and if this model had more continuous variables, for coefficients to be compared on the same scale. 

I will center and scale $log(LotArea)_i$ by subtracting the mean of $log(LotArea)_i$ and dividing it by the standard deviation. The average value of the standardised variable becomes zero with standard deviation one. I can now interpret $\alpha$ as the mean outcome value when the predictors are at their average, now zero.

$$
x_i = \frac{log(LotArea)_i - \overline{log(LotArea)}}{\sigma_{log(LotArea)}}
$$

I will divide $log(SP)_i$ by its mean value. The will make the average value of the outcome variable to be mean 1. Since SalePrice is on the log scale, a value of 1.1 for scaled $log(SP)_i$ can be interpreted as 10\% higher relative to the average value. 0.7 similarly can be interpreted as 70\% of the average value.

$$
y_i = \frac{log(SalesPrice)_i}{\overline{log(SalesPrice)}}
$$

### Selecting priors

I have chosen weakly informative priors following the advice of the [stan developers](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations). I do not have domain expertise in this specific dataset to give more informative priors. I do have some understanding of how property prices worked which guided my intital EDA. However, I can still choose sensible priors that at least regularlise model results and are within the plausible outcome space.

Standardising the variables above makes it easier for me to choose weakly informative and regularising priors. I know that $\alpha$ is the average value of $y_i$ when $x_i$ is at its sample mean. So by definition, the value of $\alpha$ in this model must be 1, which is the sample mean of $log(SP)_i$. Hence I should put extremely tight priors on $\alpha$ as there are no other plausible values but 1. 

For $\beta$ we want to assign weakly informative priors to hedge against overfitting. $\beta=0$ implies that on average, there is no association between sales price and lot area. Without much prior information I want to shrink $\beta$ closer towards zero. These distributions represents beliefs before data is observed. So all we really want to do is to assign probability to all plausible values, with less weight on extreme relationships. 

Put another way, weakly regulating priors express my priors as: the parameters of this model have from the sample is overstating the relationship of the "true" conditional mean.
-->

### 3)  Prior predictive checks - simulate data from the implied generative model
<!--{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}-->

Prior predictive checks will help us understand the implications of our priors. Parameters are simulated from the joint prior distribution and visualised to see the implied relationships between the target and predictor variables. This will help diagnose any problems with our assumptions and modelling decisions.

<!--_without_ evaluating the likelihood (i.e before the model is trained on the data). We can then see what the implied relationships of the outcome variable `y` is relative to the actual outcome. -->

I've provided some commented stan code below which shows how to specify the no pooling model and execute it via python.

```{python, eval = FALSE}
no_pooling_stan_code = '''

    if(run_estimation==1){
        target += normal_lpdf(log_sales_price | alpha[neighbourhood] + beta * log_lot_area, sigma);

    }
}
'''

# Dictionary contains all data inputs
npm_data_check = dict(N = len(df),
                      log_sales_price = df['log_sales_price_z'],
                      log_lot_area = df['log_lot_area_z'],
                      neighbourhood = df['neighbourhood'],
                      N_neighbourhood = len(df['neighbourhood'].unique()),
                      alpha_sd = 1, 
                      beta_sd = 1, 
                      run_estimation = 0)

# Draw samples from joint prior distribution

# Extract samples into a pandas dataframe

```
The codes includes all the inputs necessary to estimate the model on the data. Setting `run_estimation = 0` and including the conditional statement in the stan code means stan will only simulate values from the joint prior distribution since the likelihood is not evaluated (thanks to Jim for this handy [tip](https://khakieconomics.github.io/2017/04/30/An-easy-way-to-simulate-fake-data-in-stan.html)). 

> For the prior predictive checks, we recommend not cleaving too closely to the observed data and instead aiming for a prior data generating process that can produce plausible data sets, not necessarily ones that are indistinguishable from observed data. - [Visualisation Bayesian Workflow - Gabry, Simpson, Vehtari, Betancourt, Gelman (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01449.pdf)

The implied predictions of our priors are visualised below. I've arbitrarily chosen the 4th neighbourhood index ($\alpha_{j=4}$) since the priors for the neighbourhoods are the same. Weakly informative priors should create bounds between possible values while allowing for some implausible relationships. Remembering that 95\% of gaussian mass exists within two standard deviations of the mean is a useful guide for determining what is reasonable. 

Let's set see an example of setting uninformative priors and its implications of the data generating process. I've set the scale parameters for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be 10 which are quite diffuse. The implied predictions of the mean are much wider are well beyond the the minimum and maximum values in the real data. This suggests that the model is giving too much probabilistic weight to highly implausible datasets. 

```{python, eval=FALSE}
npm_data_check_wide = dict(N = len(df),
                      log_sales_price = df['log_sales_price_std'],
                      log_lot_area = df['log_lot_area_z'],
                      neighbourhood = df['neighbourhood'],
                      N_neighbourhood = len(df['Neighborhood'].unique()),
                      alpha_sd = 10, 
                      beta_sd = 10, 
                      run_estimation = 0)

fit_npm_check_wide = no_pooling_model.sampling(data=npm_data_check_wide)
npm_df_check_wide = fit_npm_check_wide.to_dataframe()

_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (13, 8))

x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 200)

for alpha, beta in zip(npm_df_check_wide["alpha[4]"][:100], npm_df_check_wide["beta"][:100]):
    y = alpha + beta * x
    ax.plot(x, y, c="k", alpha=0.4)

ax.set_xlabel("x (z-scores)")

ax.set_title("Prior predictive checks -- Uninformative (flat) priors");
```

Our original scale parameters of 1 produce more reasonable relationships. There are still some extreme regression lines implied by our data generating process, but they are bounded to possible ranges relative to the diffuse priors.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (13, 8))

<!--Remember that ~95\% of gaussian mass exists within two standard deviations of the mean. So we should keep this in mind when choosing weakly informative priors to ensure that we create bounds to values which are possible while allowing relationships which are implausible. I've included an example of what happens if we choose extremely wide (uninformative) priors and its implications on the data generating process. -->

<!--Note, We should avoid evaluating our priors using the sample data as this will bias our results. 

#### Prior Predictive Check
```{python, eval=FALSE}
_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (13, 8))

x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 200)

for alpha, beta in zip(npm_df_check_wide["alpha[4]"][:100], npm_df_check_wide["beta"][:100]):
    y = alpha + beta * x
    ax.plot(x, y, c="k", alpha=0.4)

ax.set_xlabel("x (z-scores)")
ax.set_ylabel("Fitted y (z-scores)")
ax.set_title("Prior predictive checks -- Uninformative (flat) priors");
```

<center>
![](figures/4_prior_predictive_check.svg)
</center>

#### Uninformative prior
I set the scale parameters for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be 10. The graph below shows that these priors are quite uninformative and diffuse. The implied predictions of the mean are much wider are well beyond the the minimum and maximum values in the real data. This suggests that the model is giving too much probabilistic weight to highly implausible datasets. 

```{python, eval=FALSE}
npm_data_check_wide = dict(N = len(df),
                      log_sales_price = df['log_sales_price_std'],
                      log_lot_area = df['log_lot_area_z'],
                      neighbourhood = df['neighbourhood'],
                      N_neighbourhood = len(df['Neighborhood'].unique()),
                      alpha_sd = 10, 
                      beta_sd = 10, 
                      run_estimation = 0)

fit_npm_check_wide = no_pooling_model.sampling(data=npm_data_check_wide)
npm_df_check_wide = fit_npm_check_wide.to_dataframe()

_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (13, 8))

x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 200)

for alpha, beta in zip(npm_df_check_wide["alpha[4]"][:100], npm_df_check_wide["beta"][:100]):
    y = alpha + beta * x
    ax.plot(x, y, c="k", alpha=0.4)

ax.set_xlabel("x (z-scores)")
ax.set_ylabel("Fitted y (z-scores)")
ax.set_title("Prior predictive checks -- Uninformative (flat) priors");

Doing so allows us to see the consequences of our assumptions and modelling decisions.-->

### 4)  Fit model on fake data
Take a draw from the prior samples (let's say the 50th simulation) and estimate the model on the fake data produced by these parameters. Let's see if the model fitted on fake data can capture the "true" parameters (dotted red lines) of the data generating process. If the model cannot capture the _known_ parameters which generated fake data, there is no certainty it will be estimating the correct parameters on real data.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Pick random simulation, let's say 50
random_draw = 50

# Extract the simulated (fake) data implied by the parameters in sample 50
y_sim = npm_df_check.filter(regex = 'y_hat').iloc[random_draw, :]

# Extract the parameteres corresponding to sample 50
true_parameters = npm_df_check.filter(regex = 'alpha|beta|sigma').iloc[random_draw, :]

# Fit the model on the fake data
_npm_data_check = dict(N = len(df),
              log_sales_price = y_sim, # target is now the extracted fake data in sample 50
              log_lot_area = df['log_lot_area_z'],
              neighbourhood = df['neighbourhood'],
              N_neighbourhood = len(df['Neighborhood'].unique()),
              alpha_sd = 1,
              beta_sd = 1, 
              run_estimation = 1)

_fit_npm_check = no_pooling_model.sampling(data=_npm_data_check)
_npm_df_check = _fit_npm_check.to_dataframe()
fake_fit = _npm_df_check.filter(regex = 'alpha|beta|sigma')
parameter_df = pd.melt(fake_fit)

# Plot will give distributions of all parameteres to see if it can capture the known parameters
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=max(2, math.ceil(fake_fit.shape[1] / 6)), ncols=6, sharex=False, sharey = True, figsize=(21,13))
fig.suptitle('Model Checking - red lines are "true" parameters', size = 30)
axes_list = [item for sublist in axes for item in sublist] 
parameters = parameter_df[['variable']].drop_duplicates().set_index('variable').index
grouped = parameter_df.groupby("variable")

for parameter in parameters:
    selection = grouped.get_group(parameter)
    ax = axes_list.pop(0)
    selection.plot.kde(label=parameter, ax=ax, legend=False)
    ax.set_title(parameter)
    ax.grid(linewidth=0.25)
    ax.axvline(x=true_parameters[parameter], color='red', linestyle='--', alpha = 0.5)

# Now use the matplotlib .remove() method to delete anything we didn't use
for ax in axes_list:
    ax.remove()

plt.tight_layout()
```

The model sufficiently captured the known parameters. The next post will go through a more interesting example where this fails and requires us to rethink how we specified our models.

### 5)  Estimate model on real data

Set `run_estimation=1` and run the code to fit the model. Stan will sample the joint posterior distribution using the default Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the [No-U-Turn sampler (NUTs)](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_18/reference-manual/hmc-algorithm-parameters.html).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Dictionary with data inputs - set run_estimation=1
npm_data = dict(N = len(df),
              log_sales_price = df['log_sales_price_std'],
              log_lot_area = df['log_lot_area_z'],
              neighbourhood = df['neighbourhood'],
              N_neighbourhood = len(df['Neighborhood'].unique()),
              alpha_sd = 1, 
              beta_sd = 1, 
              run_estimation = 1)

# Fit model by sampling from posterior distribution
fit_npm = no_pooling_model.sampling(data=npm_data)

# For generating viusalisations using the arviz package
npm_az = az.from_pystan(
    posterior=fit_npm,
    posterior_predictive="y_hat",
    observed_data="log_sales_price",
    log_likelihood='log_lik',
)

# Extract samples into dataframe
fit_npm_df = fit_npm.to_dataframe()
```
### 6) Check whether MCMC sampler and model fit
Stan won't have trouble sampling from such a simple model, so I won't go through chain diagnostics. However, we can see the posterior distributions of all the parameters by looking at the traceplot:
```{python,eval=FALSE}
# Inspect model fit
az.plot_trace(fit_npm, 
              var_names=["alpha", "beta", "sigma"], 
              compact = True, 
              chain_prop = 'color')
```

<center>
![](figures/7_trace_plot.svg)
</center>

### 7) Posterior predictive check to evaluate model performance
How well did the model perform? We can perform posterior predictive checks to see if sampled distributions from the fitted model can approximate the density of `SalesPrice` in the training data. If the model performs well, it should be able to retrodict the density of the data used to train the model. The blue lines are the predictions drawn from the joint posterior distribution compared with the observed density of the target $y$ variable.


```{python, eval=FALSE}
az.plot_ppc(data = npm_az, 
            kind = 'kde', 
            data_pairs = {'log_sales_price' : 'y_hat'},
            legend = True,
            color='cyan',
            mean = False,
            figsize=(8, 5),
            alpha = 0.5,
            num_pp_samples=200)
```

<center>
![](figures/8_posterior_predictive_check.svg)
</center>

Reversing the data transformations gives back the posterior predictive checks on the natural scale (rescale $y$ and exponentiate `log(SalesPrice)` to get back `SalesPrice`:

```{python,eval=FALSE}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize = (13, 8))
np.exp(fit_npm_df.filter(regex = 'y_hat')*df['log_sales_price'].mean()) \\
                                                               .T\\
                                                               .iloc[:, :300]\\
                                                               .plot.kde(legend = False, 
                                                                         title = 'Posterior predcitve checks', 
                                                                         xlim = (30000,500000),
                                                                         alpha = 0.1,
                                                                         ax = axes);
df['SalePrice'].plot.kde(legend = False, 
                         xlim = (30000,500000),
                         alpha = 1,
                         ax = axes);
```

Not bad for a simple model. There is definitely room for iteration and improvement.

### Conclusion

The last things we should do is compare the fits of multiple models and evaluate their performance using cross validation. Since we only fitted a single model, I have reserved this for the next post which applies the complete workflow on more complex multilevel/hierarchical models. Model performance can also be evaluated on out of sample test data as well since this is a predictive task (this kaggle competition computes the log RMSE of the out of sample dataset).

This is not an exhaustive review of all the diagnostics and visualiastions that can be performed in a workflow. There are many ways of evaluating model fit and diagnostics that could validate or invalidate the model. I hope this was a useful example of building a simple bayesian model.

<!--
Furthermore, I focused on variables which made sense to me 


The dataset is contains 80 variables and 1460 rows, with the dependent (target) variable being the `SalePrice`. The 79 other features describe various characteristics of the dwelling. 


In this post, by following and practising steps promoted by other authors, I was able to more easily debug my own issues and identify problems with my own assumptions. 

This is by no means a full data analysis which attempts to give the _best_ out of sample predictive performance. Rather, it is a way of practising

and identifying errors + evaluating assumptions. 

I've taken what i learnt in SR and applied it to a kaggle dataset using a recommended bayesian workflow - in the spirit of being principled with my current state of knowledge. This has been inspried by JSs blog posts and more recently, MA's blog post and the visualisation paper. I do my best to replicate a robust analysis outlined by these resources. However, I stop short of MB's notebook (I still have a lot to learn!)

Why? To practice and understand bayesian modelling in the context of problems - to provide my own analysis. Improve probabilistic programming.
